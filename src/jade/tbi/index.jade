						p.citation A new study documents a type of brain damage that occurs in collegiate football players in a typical season and in the absence of concussion. 
						p Hirad and colleagues (2019) used MRI to measure the structural changes that occur in an athlete’s brain from a single season of football. The critical finding is that there are stereotyped patterns of brain injury that are asymptomatic—meaning no signs or symptoms of concussion.
						p The tools below provide a visualization of how force loading during football affects brain structure.

						p.tbi-model-meta Interactive model of data from Figure 6 in Hirad and colleagues (2019). The 3D model shown here is a graphical representation of how force loading from head hits during football (practice and games) is related to differences between damage to the left and right hemispheres of the brain.
