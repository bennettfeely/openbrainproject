						p New research indicates that brain damage can occur in football players in the absence of concussion.
						p Hirad and colleagues (2019) used MRI to measure the structural changes that occur in an athleteâ€™s brain from a single season of football. They found stereotyped patterns of injury to a critical part of the brain, the midbrain. The injury was present even in players who never exhibited signs or symptoms of concussion.
						p The tool below provides a visualization of how force loading during football affects brain structure.

								p Interactive model of data from Figure 6 in Hirad and colleagues (2019). The 3D model shown here is a graphical representation of how force loading from head hits during football (practice and games) is related to differences between damage to the left and right hemispheres of the brain.
