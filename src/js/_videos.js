			"Music is not only a major part of Dan Fabbio’s life, as a music teacher it is his livelihood. So when doctors discovered a tumor located in the part of his brain responsible for music function, he began a long journey that involved a team of University of Rochester physicians, scientists, and a music professor and culminated with him awake and playing a saxophone as surgeons operated on his brain."

			"Intra-operative direct electrical stimulation (DES) mapping at the surface of the cortex during patient AH’s surgery. Top Left. The in-house software (‘StrongView’) used for presentation of experimental stimuli (e.g. naming pictures, numbers), which also records audio and video of the patient’s face in real time. Electrocorticography is also displayed in real time. Bottom Left. As the surgeon applies electrical current using a bipolar stimulator, the coordinates of that stimulation are shown on slices of the patient’s pre-operative T1 weighted scan. Right Side. Video of the patient’s brain during intra-operative mapping. Recording electrodes are placed throughout cortex to monitor for after-discharges induced by stimulation."

			"Intra-operative video showing subcortical stimulation of the frontal aslant tract. For each stimulation event, a coronal and sagittal slice is shown. The frontal aslant tract is shown in blue in the MRI images. The red dot depicts the location in the brain of the current stimulation event. Prior stimulation coordinates are shown as white spheres. This video shows representative stimulation and non-stimulation trials. Video from: www.tbm.urmc.org"
